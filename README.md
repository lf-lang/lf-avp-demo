# XronOS
Port of Autoware to LF using the federated runtime currently only supported in the C target.

To be able to use this branch, clone the [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca) repository and use the [ROS-serialization](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/tree/ROS-serialization) branch.


Note: 
This effort is in parallel to the port of Autoware using the Cpp target, which is the native language of Autoware.
